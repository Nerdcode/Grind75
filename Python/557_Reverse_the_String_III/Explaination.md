The code you provided is written in Python and defines a class called Solution with a single method named reverseWords. This method takes a single argument s, which is expected to be a string, and returns a string where the individual words in the input string are reversed while keeping the order of words the same. The method essentially reverses the letters within each word.

Let's break down the code step by step:

```
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
```
This code defines a Python class named Solution, which likely encapsulates various methods related to problem-solving.

Inside the Solution class, there's a method named reverseWords. It takes two parameters:

self: This is a reference to the instance of the class, allowing the method to access and modify its attributes.
s: This parameter is of type string (str) and represents the input string whose words need to be reversed. The method also specifies that it will return a string (-> str).

```
    x = s.split()
```
The split() method is called on the input string s, which splits the string into a list of words based on spaces (the default separator). The resulting list of words is assigned to the variable x.

An empty list named arr is initialized. This list will be used to store the reversed words and spaces.
A for loop iterates through each word in the list x, which contains the words from the input string split by spaces.
Inside the loop, each word i is reversed using slicing (i[::-1]) and then appended to the arr list. This effectively reverses the order of characters within each word.

After reversing a word, a space character is appended to the arr list. This step ensures that there is a space between each reversed word in the final result.


```
        arr=[]
        for i in x :
            arr.append(i[::-1])
            arr.append(" ")
        return "".join(arr).strip()
```

After processing all the words in the input string, the join() method is used to concatenate all the elements in the arr list into a single string. The resulting string will contain the reversed words with spaces between them.

strip() is called on the concatenated string to remove any leading or trailing spaces, ensuring that the final output string is clean and does not have extra spaces at the beginning or end.

Overall Functionality
In summary, the reverseWords method takes an input string, splits it into words, reverses each word, and then reassembles the reversed words into a single string with spaces between them. The final string is returned as the output.

Example:

Input: "Hello World"
Output: "olleH dlroW
