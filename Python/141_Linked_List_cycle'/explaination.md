This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `hasCycle` that determines whether a given singly-linked list has a cycle (loop) in it. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **ListNode Definition:**
   - The code begins with a comment indicating the definition of a singly-linked list node. This is a common data structure used to represent a node in a linked list.
   - Each `ListNode` has two attributes:
     - `val`: It stores the value of the node.
     - `next`: It is a reference to the next node in the linked list. It is initially set to `None`, indicating the end of the list.

2. **Method `hasCycle`:**
   - This method takes one parameter, `head`, which is the head (starting point) of the linked list. It is of type `Optional[ListNode]`, meaning it can be a `ListNode` or `None` (if the list is empty).
   - The method returns a boolean value: `True` if there is a cycle in the linked list, and `False` otherwise.

3. **Cycle Detection Algorithm:**
   - Inside the `hasCycle` method, two pointers, `slow_p` and `fast_p`, are initialized to the head of the linked list (`head`).
   - A `while` loop is used for the cycle detection. It continues as long as both `slow_p` and `fast_p` are not `None`, and `fast_p.next` is not `None`. The condition `fast_p.next` checks if the next node exists, so the fast pointer can safely move two steps at a time without causing errors.
   - Within each iteration of the loop:
     - `slow_p` advances one step by setting `slow_p` to its next node: `slow_p = slow_p.next`.
     - `fast_p` advances two steps by setting `fast_p` to its next node's next node: `fast_p = fast_p.next.next`.
     - If at any point during the loop, the `slow_p` and `fast_p` pointers meet (i.e., `slow_p` becomes equal to `fast_p`), this indicates the presence of a cycle, and the method returns `True`.
   - If the loop completes without finding a cycle, the method returns `False`, indicating that there is no cycle in the linked list.

In summary, this code uses the "tortoise and hare" approach to detect cycles in a singly-linked list. It employs two pointers moving at different speeds to determine if the linked list contains a loop or not. If they meet at some point, there is a cycle, and the method returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
